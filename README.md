### a Sails application

================

A practice app for learning SailsJS - A Rails like MVC framework for NodeJS

This application uses some particular modules:
- sails-mysql (for SailsJs MySql adapter)
- bcryptjs (for encrypting passwords)

to install locally just: npm install

Lastly, be sure to add your own local.js file in the config folder.
Local.js file is not committed by default. (Put your credentials and important local details there e.g. adapters)

Tired of those "sails lift" everytime you make changes to your project?
Then try installing nodemon: npm install -g nodemon
Now, in your Sails project directory just type: nodemon
